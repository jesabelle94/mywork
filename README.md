## About This Project

This project is about my analysis of the famous [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html#highlights) dataset and the variables in contains. The Palmer Penguins dataset is a popular 
dataset used for teaching and learning purposes in data science and machine learning. It contains information about three species of penguins: Ad√©lie, 
Chinstrap, and Gentoo.
