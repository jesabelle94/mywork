## About This Project

This project is about my analysis of the famous palmer penguins dataset and the variables in contains. The Palmer Penguins dataset is a popular 
dataset used for teaching and learning purposes in data science and machine learning. It contains information about three species of penguins: Ad√©lie, 
Chinstrap, and Gentoo. 

This dataset is often used for tasks such as classification, clustering, and data visualization. The data set is available [on GitHub](https://
allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)
