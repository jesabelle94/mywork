# My Work

Principles of Data Analytics module.
This README has been written with [GitHub's documentation on READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.
You can find out more about [writing in Markdown in GitHub's documentation](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html#highlights).

## About This Project

This project is about my analysis of the famous [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html#highlights) dataset and the variables in contains. The Palmer Penguins dataset is a popular 
dataset used for teaching and learning purposes in data science and machine learning. It contains information about three species of penguins: Ad√©lie, 
Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

## Use of This Project

This project is useful for getting started with Data Analytics and importantly to demonstrate the following:
- Source and investigate sets of data.
- Programmatically explore and visualize data.
- Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets.
- Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
- Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
- Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.


## Get Started

To undertake this project, it is necessary to download and install all the required software, as well as set up a GitHub account.
- [Cmder](https://cmder.app/)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/jesabelle94)

The project focuses on [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) data set. [Copy of the data set here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv)


I used [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the following clickable link.
It opens the `penguins.ipynb` notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).


## Get Help

Where users can get help with your project

My Principles of Data Analytics lecturer, Ian, played a significant role in initiating this project. His [lecture videos](https://atlantictu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ian_mcloughlin_atu_ie/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fian%5Fmcloughlin%5Fatu%5Fie%2FDocuments%2Fstudent%5Fshares%2Fprinciples%5Fof%5Fdata%5Fanalytics&ga=1) offered invaluable insights throughout the course, showcasing a deep understanding of the material. 

I completed hours of research on this project. The websites helped me a lot with gathering ideas of the analysis and plotting data:

- [Penguin Plots: Practicing Analytics](https://rpubs.com/TEHoule/PalmerPenguinPlayground)
- [Exploring Penguin Dataset](https://rpubs.com/Saif178/1053370)
